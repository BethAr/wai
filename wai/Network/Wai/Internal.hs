-- Some questions and answers about the usage of 'Builder' here:
--
-- Q1. Shouldn't it be at the user's discretion to use Builders internally and
-- then create a stream of ByteStrings?
--
-- A1. That would be less efficient, as we wouldn't get cheap concatenation
-- with the response headers.
--
-- Q2. Isn't it really inefficient to convert from ByteString to Builder, and
-- then right back to ByteString?
--
-- A2. No. If the ByteStrings are small, then they will be copied into a larger
-- buffer, which should be a performance gain overall (less system calls). If
-- they are already large, then blaze-builder uses an InsertByteString
-- instruction to avoid copying.
--
-- Q3. Doesn't this prevent us from creating comet-style servers, since data
-- will be cached?
--
-- A3. You can force blaze-builder to output a ByteString before it is an
-- optimal size by sending a flush command.
